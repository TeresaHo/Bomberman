### CrazyLogicBomb
It's a First Person Crazy Arcade Game 

 - It only supports online mode which needs at least two players.
 - Players can choose to create a room or join an existing room
 - Before entering the game, the player decides how to distribute the given 10 points on different abilities such as moving speed, the power of his bomb, etc.
 - We built our own robot characters and made animation for each by Blender. We also directly used some other elements from Unity assets store.
 - Photon function is also used to achieve online battle mode for this game.
