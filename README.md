# Bomberman
first person bomberman game 
(Only uploaded scripts)
 
 It was co-written by other two of my classmates in our sophomore year using Unity.
 It only has online mode which at least needs two players.
 We built our own robot characters and made animation for each by using Blender. Of course we used some other charaters from assets store.
 Photon is also used to achieve this online mode for this game.
